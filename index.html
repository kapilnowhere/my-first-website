  <h1>Explainable AI (XAI): Making AI Transparent</h1>

  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Kapil Singh <br>

  <h2>üîç What is Explainable AI?</h2>
  <p>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) refers to techniques and methods that make the behavior of AI systems understandable to humans. As AI models, especially deep learning models, become more complex, it becomes harder to understand why they make certain decisions. XAI aims to bridge this gap.</p>

  <h2>ü§ñ Why Do We Need Explainability?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Users are more likely to trust AI systems if they can understand how decisions are made.</li>
    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Helps identify and fix biased or unfair decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> Easier to improve AI systems when we can explain their failures.</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Legal frameworks (like GDPR) may require explainability in automated decisions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üß∞ Common XAI Techniques</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):</strong> Explains predictions by approximating the model locally with an interpretable one.</li>
    <li><strong>SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):</strong> Based on game theory, assigns importance values to features.</li>
    <li><strong>Saliency Maps:</strong> Used in image classification to highlight areas most important for a decision.</li>
    <li><strong>Decision Trees:</strong> Often used as interpretable models themselves or to approximate complex ones.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Applications</h2>
  <p>XAI is used in various domains:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Explaining AI-based disease diagnosis to doctors.</li>
    <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Explaining loan approval or fraud detection systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal:</strong> Providing justifications for predictive policing or risk scoring.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges in XAI</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Trade-off between accuracy and interpretability.</li>
    <li>No universal definition of ‚Äúexplanation‚Äù.</li>
    <li>Hard to explain very deep models like GPT or CNNs for complex tasks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üìå Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Explainable AI is not just a technical challenge, but also an ethical and societal one. As AI continues to shape critical decisions, making these systems interpretable is essential for fairness, trust, and accountability.</p>
